  Senior Full-Stack Developer with 14+ Years of Experience

  I bring over 14 years of experience as a full-stack developer, adept at applying design patterns and clean code principles to deliver high-quality,<mark><b>maintainable software</b></mark>. My expertise spans both mobile development (8+ years) using <mark><b>Android</b></mark>, backend architecture with <mark><b>Python</b></mark> (5+ years) and web frontend with <mark><b>React</b></mark> (2+ years).

  Throughout my career, I've tackled projects with <mark><b>diverse technical requirements</b></mark>. This experience has fostered my strong teamwork and leadership skills, allowing me to learn from each project and continuously improve.

  I'm passionate about staying current with the latest technologies and leverage them effectively in my work. I'm also a strong advocate for Open Source Software (OSS) and actively utilize tools like Android, Git, VSCode, and Linux distributions (Manjaro) in my daily workflow.
